# Project Board Setup

Create a GitHub Project (beta) or classic Projects board for managing work.

Suggested columns:
- Backlog
- Ready
- In Progress
- In Review
- Done

Automation:
- Move issues to In Progress when a branch with `in-progress` label is created.
- Move to In Review when a PR is opened.
- Move to Done when PR merged.

Use labels: `type: bug`, `type: feature`, `priority: high`.
